## Hi there,
Welcome to my GitHub profile, and thank you for visiting!
Here you will find a collection of repositories reflecting my work and learning in:
- Linux (Arch Linux) â€“ system configuration, networking, package management, and security (SELinux)
- Software Development â€“ primarily in Go and Python
- Cloud & Container Technologies â€“ Docker, Kubernetes, and related tooling
- Performance & Benchmarking â€“ experiments such as comparing processes vs threads and other system-level studies

## Here are some details about me:
- I'm 27 years old.
- Currently living in Tokyo.
- Working in FPT Japan as a Cloud Engineer
- My main focus is AWS, Python, Terraform.
- I'm really passionate about DevOps technology such as: Kubernetes, Docker and Linux (I also have a homelab and my own environment for this)
- Currently learning GoLang to contribute to Kubernetes/Docker open source in the future.

## Homelab:
- Besides company's work, I also have a small homelab where I can practice (Application: https://github.com/xuanhung3081330/foodapplication_homelab and K3S's manifests: https://github.com/xuanhung3081330/foodinfra_homelab):
- + Kubernetes (K3S)
  + Docker
  + Linux (Arch)
  + Networking
  + GoLang
 
## Repos:
- Here are the 4 repos that I'm currently working on:
  + **myconfigs** - A playground for me to practice, learn, and experiment with Linux/OS internals.
  + **learning_go** - A playground for me to experiment, and learn the features of Go
  + **foodapplication_homelab** - This project was created as a way to learn Go. Itâ€™s nothing serious â€” just a playground backend API that I use for deploying to my bare-metal k3s cluster.
  + **foodinfra_homelab** - This project is a playground for me to practice Kubernetes.
